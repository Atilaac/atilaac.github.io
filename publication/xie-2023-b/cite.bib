abstract = {Synchro-Shockley dislocations, as zonal dislocation, are the major carrier of plasticity in Laves phases at high temperatures. The motion of synchro-Shockley dislocations is composed of localized transition events, such as kink-pair nucleation and propagation, which possess small activation volumes, presumably leading to sensitive temperature and strain rate dependence on the Peierls stress. However, the thermally activated nature of synchro-Shockley dislocation motion is not fully understood so far. In this study, the transition mechanisms of the motion of synchro-Shockley dislocations at different shear and normal strain levels are studied. The transition processes of dislocation motion can be divided into shear-sensitive and -insensitive events. The external shear strain lowers the energy barriers of shear-sensitive events. Thermal assistance is indispensable in activating shear-insensitive events, implying that the motion of synchro-Shockley dislocations is prohibited at low temperatures.}
