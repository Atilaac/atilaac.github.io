title = {On the presence of nanoscale heterogeneity in Ni15Al70Co15 metallic glass under pressure},
abstract = {We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dependence of the atomic-scale structure on the temperature and pressure conditions of Al$_{70}$Ni$_{15}$Co$_{15}$ metallic glass. The glass transition temperature showed an increase with pressure. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the applied pressure affects the local structure of glass. The glasses cooled under high-pressures showed a significant fraction of embedded crystalline structure, which was found to be surrounded by a region of mixed-like clusters playing the role of an interface between the crystalline and the glassy regions. The correlation length, as calculated from the full width at half maximum of the first sharp diffraction peak, indicated an increase of the medium-range order with pressure. The evolution of the heterogeneity with pressure was highlighted by the existence of nanoscale crystals (1 to 4 nm in size) embedded in the amorphous zone. Finally, we discuss the results by referring to the atomic potential energy and stress.},
