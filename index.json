After finishing his M.Sc, he moved to Germany and started a Ph.D. in the group of Prof. Dr.-ing. Erik Bitzek at the Institute I: General Materials Properties, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, FAU in Erlangen. Starting from July 2022 he joined the group of Prof. Dr. Martin Müser as a postdoctoral research associate working on atomistic simulations of different organic and inorganic materials. From July 2021 till December 2022, Achraf held a guest scientist position at Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung GmbH in Düsseldorf, Germany.\nAchraf is a computational material scientist, focusing on amorphous materials, with a strong interest in the relationship between composition, structure, and other physical properties. His research mostly focuses on the mechanical behavior and deformation mechanisms in glasses.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/author/dr.-achraf-atila/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dr.-achraf-atila/","section":"authors","summary":"Dr. Achraf Atila studied physics at the University of Hassan II in Casablanca, from which he obtained his Bachelor of Science in physics and applications in 2015 and Master of Science in physics and new technologies in 2017.","tags":null,"title":"Dr. Achraf Atila","type":"authors"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Oxide glasses are excellent bioactive materials. Most bioactive glasses are found within the ternary soda-lime silicate. These systems are known to have a relatively slow interaction with the physiological fluid, making the dissolving process slower and keeping the glass in the body for longer times than the tissue\u0026rsquo;s recovery period, which is undesirable. Moreover, most of these glasses have relatively low mechanical properties making their usage in different implantation zones difficult. Research in the field focused on the compositional design of bioactive glasses to tailor their properties. In this project, we are focused on investigating the effect of the thermodynamic history of the glasses on their physical properties (e.g., mechanical) and bioactivity using large scale classical and reactive atomistic simulations. The effect of alkali and alkaline earth elements is also investigated together with the glass surface reactivity.\n","date":1592059687,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592059687,"objectID":"7899c1bda108402c7908bf80919bc938","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/project/bioactive-glasses/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T16:48:07+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/bioactive-glasses/","section":"project","summary":"Study the bioactivity of glasses","tags":["Bioactive Glasses"],"title":"Bioactive Glasses","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592059676,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592059676,"objectID":"0305362fc3e14a3d8288f75a2acf28dc","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/project/metallic-glasses/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T16:47:56+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/metallic-glasses/","section":"project","summary":"Investigate the properties of metallic glasses","tags":["Metallic Glasses"],"title":"Metallic Glasses","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592059665,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592059665,"objectID":"9f28856a5982b6371e2251a075ba634e","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/project/oxide-glasses/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T16:47:45+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/oxide-glasses/","section":"project","summary":"Study the properties of oxide glasses","tags":["Oxide Glasses"],"title":"Oxide Glasses","type":"project"}]
