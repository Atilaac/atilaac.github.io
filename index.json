Usually, the glass network modifiers (e.g., Na$_2$O) affect the behavior of T$_g$. However, in aluminosilicate glasses, the effect of different modifiers on T$_g$ is still unclear and show an anomalous behavior. Here, based on molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the glass transition temperature decreases with increasing charge balancing cations field strength (FS) in the aluminosilicate glasses, which is an anomalous behavior as compared to other oxide glasses. The results show that the origins of this anomaly come from the dynamics of the supercooled liquid above T$_g$, which in turn is correlated to pair excess entropy. Our results deepen our understanding of the effect of different modifiers on the properties of the aluminosilicate glasses.","tags":null,"title":"Ionic Self-Diffusion and the Glass Transition Anomaly in Aluminosilicates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Achraf Atila","El Mehdi Ghardi","Abdellatif Hasnaoui","Said Ouaskit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"8325320cef9f5e2e5c072fb81dd14754","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/publication/atila-2019-a/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T10:12:16.893214Z","relpermalink":"/publication/atila-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"We rely on molecular dynamics simulations to investigate and discuss the effect of alumina content on the thermodynamic, elastic and structural properties of calcium aluminosilicate glasses in the light of available experimental data. The alumina content varies from low to intermediate ranges by considering compositions of (CaO---SiO$_2$)$_{1−x}$---(Al$_2$O$_3$)$_x$ where x = 0---30 mol%. The glass transition temperature was found by referring to the concept of inherent structure energy while elastic properties were computed using two methods: the first is via molecular statics using energy minimization and the second one by performing molecular dynamics at a finite temperature. We suggest a correlation between structural changes, mechanical properties and glass transition temperature, through an analysis of the short and medium range orders. The results show that by increasing Al$_2$O$_3$ content, an increase in the population of bridging oxygens and oxygen tricluster is observed while free oxygens tend to vanish. Regions with rich Al---O---Al linkages start to appear as shown by the aluminium avoidance parameter, which is also accompanied with an increase of the glass transition temperature and elastic moduli.","tags":null,"title":"Alumina effect on the structure and properties of calcium aluminosilicate in the percalcic region: A molecular dynamics investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Achraf Atila","El Mehdi Ghardi","Said Ouaskit","Abdellatif Hasnaoui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"20461093bd547680af74d87c5db50c7e","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/publication/atila-2019-b/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T10:12:20.971308Z","relpermalink":"/publication/atila-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Ternary aluminosilicate glasses are of great interest in glass and earth sciences. The structural role of the non-network cations is not fully understood until now. Understanding the structural effect of the non-network cations is necessary for explaining their impact on the macroscopic properties of aluminosilicate glasses. In this work, we use molecular dynamics to investigate physical properties of a series of charge balanced aluminosilicate glasses. Elastic properties and the glass transition temperature were calculated. Our results are in accordance with the experimental data found in the literature. We found that elastic moduli increase with the charge balancing cations field strength (FS), while the glass transition temperature is negatively correlated to FS. The effect of the charge balancing cations field strength on the calculated properties is discussed and explained using the change in the structural properties, energetic environment of atoms, and two-body excess entropy. This allows us to get an overview of the effect of cations nature on the properties of the glass.","tags":null,"title":"Atomistic insights into the impact of charge balancing cations on the structure and properties of aluminosilicate glasses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["El Mehdi Ghardi","Achraf Atila","Michael Badawi","Abdellatif Hasnaoui","Said Ouaskit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"0fbe0cf6e666333bfd5058b1267c1fa0","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/publication/ghardi-2019/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T10:11:35.502648Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ghardi-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding the role of TiO$_2$ in BaO‐TiO$_2$‐SiO$_2$ (BTS) glasses is one of the keys to develop new glasses and glass‐ceramics for different technological applications. For the first time, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to get new insights into the atomic structure of the BTS glasses and their elastic moduli. Various compositions are studied where SiO$_2$ have been replaced by TiO$_2$. The calculated mechanical properties of our models are observed to depend linearly on TiO2 content. However, the structure‐induced changes are far from such dependence. The structural results indicate that BTS glasses are mainly built on four types of basic units: SiO$_4$, TiO$_4$, TiO$_5$ and TiO$_6$. This high structural heterogeneity induced by the three coordination states of Ti is found to have an impact on the medium range order by increasing the rings number, the polymerized regions, and by transforming Q$^3$‐Q$^4$ and Q$^2$ without neglecting the increase in Q$^5$ and Q$^6$ species. Those structural modifications of the BTS glass network features have been found to be consistent with available experimental data.","tags":null,"title":"Computational insights into the structure of barium titanosilicate glasses","type":"publication"}]
