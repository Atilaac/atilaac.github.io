The soda-lime phosphosilicate glasses, such as 45S5, represent a model system of bioactive glasses. Regardless of their importance as bioactive materials, the relationship between the structure, pressure, and cooling process was not studied in detail. This affects the progress of further development of bioactive glasses negatively. Our contribution to the field of bioactive glasses is to tailor/ enhance the mechanical properties of bioactive glasses. We used molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamical, elastic, and structural properties of densified 45S5 bioactive glass over a large range of densities. We performed a systematic analysis of the glass structure to density in order correlate the change in the properties to the structural change with a target to enhance the mechanical elasticity of the bioactive glasses while keeping their bioactive nature. The results show that the glass structure tends to be repolymerized as indicated by an increase of the network connectivity. This, was accompanied by a tetrahedral to octahedral polyhedral transformation. We were able to tailor the elastic properties while keeping the bioactivity of the glass. This to the best of our knowledge the first study to address the improvement of the elastic/ mechanical properties of bioactive glasses through densification.\nThe results obtained in these studies will allow us to enhance the mechanical properties of bioactive glasses and opens a new window for further development and optimization of the bioglasses properties.\nMore studies are to be published soon, stay tuned.\n","date":1592059687,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592059687,"objectID":"7899c1bda108402c7908bf80919bc938","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/project/bioactive-glasses/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T16:48:07+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/bioactive-glasses/","section":"project","summary":"Study the bioactivity of glasses","tags":["Bioactive Glasses"],"title":"Bioactive Glasses","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"We used molecular dynamics to investigate the dependence of the atomic-scale structure on the temperature and pressure in Ni$_{15}$Co$_{15}$Al$_{70}$ metallic glass.

The alumina content varies from low to intermediate ranges by considering compositions of (CaO---SiO$_2$)$_{1−x}$---(Al$_2$O$_3$)$_x$ where x = 0---30 mol%. The glass transition temperature was found by referring to the concept of inherent structure energy while elastic properties were computed using two methods: the first is via molecular statics using energy minimization and the second one by performing molecular dynamics at a finite temperature. We suggest a correlation between structural changes, mechanical properties and glass transition temperature, through an analysis of the short and medium range orders. The results show that by increasing Al$_2$O$_3$ content, an increase in the population of bridging oxygens and oxygen tricluster is observed while free oxygens tend to vanish. Regions with rich Al---O---Al linkages start to appear as shown by the aluminium avoidance parameter, which is also accompanied with an increase of the glass transition temperature and elastic moduli.","tags":null,"title":"Alumina effect on the structure and properties of calcium aluminosilicate in the percalcic region: A molecular dynamics investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Achraf Atila","El Mehdi Ghardi","Said Ouaskit","Abdellatif Hasnaoui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"20461093bd547680af74d87c5db50c7e","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/publication/atila-2019-b/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T10:12:20.971308Z","relpermalink":"/publication/atila-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Ternary aluminosilicate glasses are of great interest in glass and earth sciences.

For the first time, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to get new insights into the atomic structure of the BTS glasses and their elastic moduli. Various compositions are studied where SiO$_2$ have been replaced by TiO$_2$. The calculated mechanical properties of our models are observed to depend linearly on TiO2 content. However, the structure‐induced changes are far from such dependence. The structural results indicate that BTS glasses are mainly built on four types of basic units: SiO$_4$, TiO$_4$, TiO$_5$ and TiO$_6$. This high structural heterogeneity induced by the three coordination states of Ti is found to have an impact on the medium range order by increasing the rings number, the polymerized regions, and by transforming Q$^3$‐Q$^4$ and Q$^2$ without neglecting the increase in Q$^5$ and Q$^6$ species. Those structural modifications of the BTS glass network features have been found to be consistent with available experimental data.","tags":null,"title":"Computational insights into the structure of barium titanosilicate glasses","type":"publication"}]
