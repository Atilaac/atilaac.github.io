The effect of pressure variations on the glass transition temperature was also studied, showing an increase with pressure. Moreover, radial distribution function, coordination number, and Voronoi tessellation analysis indicate that the applied pressure affects the local structure of glassy Al$_{70}$Ni$_{15}$Co$_{15}$. We used a local symmetry parameter to access the glass-forming ability of the metallic glasses cooled under different pressures. The glasses cooled under high-pressures showed a significant fraction of embedded crystalline structure, which was found to be surrounded by a region of mixed-like clusters playing the role of an interface between the crystalline region and the glassy region. The correlation length, as calculated from the full width at half maximum of the first sharp diffraction peak, indicated an increase of the medium-range order with the increase of pressure. The evolution of the heterogeneity with pressure was highlighted by the existence of nanoscale crystals (1 to 4 nm in size)embedded in the amorphous zone. Finally, we discuss the results by referring to the atomic potential energy and stress.","tags":["Metallic Glasses"],"title":"On the presence of nanoscale heterogeneity in Al$_{70}$Ni$_{15}$Co$_{15}$ metallic glass under pressure","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592059687,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592059687,"objectID":"7899c1bda108402c7908bf80919bc938","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/project/bioactive-glasses/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T16:48:07+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/bioactive-glasses/","section":"project","summary":"Study the bioactivity of glasses","tags":["Bioactive Glasses"],"title":"Bioactive Glasses","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592059676,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592059676,"objectID":"0305362fc3e14a3d8288f75a2acf28dc","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/project/metallic-glasses/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T16:47:56+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/metallic-glasses/","section":"project","summary":"Investigate the properties of metallic glasses","tags":["Metallic Glasses"],"title":"Metallic Glasses","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592059665,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592059665,"objectID":"9f28856a5982b6371e2251a075ba634e","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/project/oxide-glasses/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T16:47:45+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/oxide-glasses/","section":"project","summary":"Study the properties of oxide glasses","tags":["Oxide Glasses"],"title":"Oxide Glasses","type":"project"},{"authors":["Achraf Atila"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591228800,"objectID":"41ab6dca5efe94dc382e2e8e0449aee7","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/publication/atila-2020-b/","publishdate":"2020-07-02T12:45:59.292725Z","relpermalink":"/publication/atila-2020-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Oxide glasses are generally formed by a network of glass former polyhedra, and network modifiers having the role, either to neutralize/ stabilize the charge of the glass former polyhedra or depolymerize the glass network. The effect of the modifier content on the structure and properties of the glass are to some extent, well known. However, the effect of the type of modifiers on the clustering and the tendency to form a phase separation in the glass is not investigated in detail and still not fully understood until now. Here, we use molecular dynamics to investigate the effect of the modifier type on the structure and the clustering tendency of a series of modified silicate glasses. Specifically, we show that the tendency of modifier—modifier cluster formation is linked to the modifier size and modifier—oxygen bond strength. The effect of different modifiers on the short- and medium-range structure of the glass is also discussed. This allows us to get an overview of the effect of cations nature on the properties of the glass and opens a new window for further development and optimization of the glass properties.","tags":["Oxide Glasses"],"title":"Atomic Structure and Modifiers Clustering in Silicate glasses: Effect of Modifier Cations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Achraf Atila","Said Ouaskit","Abdellatif Hasnaoui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587686400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587686400,"objectID":"9c48cdc0691dd04fa91e1c90e7339276","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/publication/atila-2020-a/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T10:12:24.290334Z","relpermalink":"/publication/atila-2020-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The glass transition temperature (T$_g$) is the temperature, after which the supercooled liquid undergoes a dynamical arrest.

The alumina content varies from low to intermediate ranges by considering compositions of (CaO---SiO$_2$)$_{1−x}$---(Al$_2$O$_3$)$_x$ where x = 0---30 mol%. The glass transition temperature was found by referring to the concept of inherent structure energy while elastic properties were computed using two methods: the first is via molecular statics using energy minimization and the second one by performing molecular dynamics at a finite temperature. We suggest a correlation between structural changes, mechanical properties and glass transition temperature, through an analysis of the short and medium range orders. The results show that by increasing Al$_2$O$_3$ content, an increase in the population of bridging oxygens and oxygen tricluster is observed while free oxygens tend to vanish. Regions with rich Al---O---Al linkages start to appear as shown by the aluminium avoidance parameter, which is also accompanied with an increase of the glass transition temperature and elastic moduli.","tags":["Oxide Glasses"],"title":"Alumina effect on the structure and properties of calcium aluminosilicate in the percalcic region: A molecular dynamics investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Achraf Atila","El Mehdi Ghardi","Said Ouaskit","Abdellatif Hasnaoui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"20461093bd547680af74d87c5db50c7e","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/publication/atila-2019-b/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T10:12:20.971308Z","relpermalink":"/publication/atila-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Ternary aluminosilicate glasses are of great interest in glass and earth sciences.

In this work, we use molecular dynamics to investigate physical properties of a series of charge balanced aluminosilicate glasses. Elastic properties and the glass transition temperature were calculated. Our results are in accordance with the experimental data found in the literature. We found that elastic moduli increase with the charge balancing cations field strength (FS), while the glass transition temperature is negatively correlated to FS. The effect of the charge balancing cations field strength on the calculated properties is discussed and explained using the change in the structural properties, energetic environment of atoms, and two-body excess entropy.

For the first time, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to get new insights into the atomic structure of the BTS glasses and their elastic moduli. Various compositions are studied where SiO$_2$ have been replaced by TiO$_2$. The calculated mechanical properties of our models are observed to depend linearly on TiO2 content. However, the structure‐induced changes are far from such dependence. The structural results indicate that BTS glasses are mainly built on four types of basic units: SiO$_4$, TiO$_4$, TiO$_5$ and TiO$_6$. This high structural heterogeneity induced by the three coordination states of Ti is found to have an impact on the medium range order by increasing the rings number, the polymerized regions, and by transforming Q$^3$‐Q$^4$ and Q$^2$ without neglecting the increase in Q$^5$ and Q$^6$ species. Those structural modifications of the BTS glass network features have been found to be consistent with available experimental data.","tags":["Oxide Glasses"],"title":"Computational insights into the structure of barium titanosilicate glasses","type":"publication"}]
