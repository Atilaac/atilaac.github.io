Hence, in recent years tailoring the properties of bioactive glasses through compositional design have become the subject of widespread interest for their use in medical application, e.g., tissue regeneration. Understanding the mixed alkali effect (MAE) in oxide glasses is of fundamental importance for tailoring the glass compositions to control the mobility of ions and, therefore, the glass properties that depend on it, such as ion release, glass transition temperature, and ionic conductivity. However, most of the previously designed bioactive glasses were based on trial-and-error, which is due to the complex glass structure that is nontrivial to analyze and, thus, the lack of a clear picture of the glass structure at short- and medium-range order. Accordingly, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study whether using the MAE can control the bioactivity and properties of 45S5 glass and its structural origins. We showed that the network connectivity, a structural parameter often used to access the bioactivity of silicate glasses, does not change with Na substitution with Li or K. On the contrary, the elastic moduli showed a strong dependence on the type of the modifier as they increased with increasing mean field strength. Similarly, the mobility of the glass elements was significantly affected by the type of modifier used to substitute Na. The change of the properties is further discussed and explained using changes at the short- and medium-range structure by giving evidence of previous experimental findings. Finally, we highlight the origin of the nonexistence of the MAE, the effect of the modifier on the bioactivity of the glasses, the importance of dynamical descriptors in predicting the bioactivity of oxide glasses, and we provide the necessary insights, at the atomic scale, needed for further development of bioactive glasses.","tags":["Oxide Glasses","Bioactive Glasses"],"title":"Atomistic insights into the mixed-alkali effect in phosphosilicate glasses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Youssef Ouldhnini","Achraf Atila","Said Ouaskit","Abdellatif Hasnaoui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1624406400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624406400,"objectID":"3529c16de1d840f14ebc94b0c0786387","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/publication/ouldhnini-2021/","publishdate":"2021-06-23T21:31:49.43341Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ouldhnini-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Glasses have applications in regenerative medicine due to their bioactivity, enabling interactions with hard and soft tissues. Soda-lime phosphosilicate glasses, such as 45S5, represent a model system of bioactive glasses. Regardless of their importance as bioactive materials, the relationship between the structure, density, and cooling process has not been studied in detail. This hinders further development of glasses as biomaterials. We used molecular dynamics simulations to study the elastic and structural properties of densified 45S5 bioactive glass and liquids over a wide range of densities. We performed a systematic analysis of the glass structure to density relationship to correlate the change in the properties with the structural change to enhance the bioactive glasses' mechanical properties while preserving their bioactive nature. The results show that the glass structure tends to be repolymerized, as indicated by increased network connectivity and a tetrahedral to octahedral polyhedral transition. We were able to tailor the elastic properties while keeping the bioactivity of the glass. The results presented here will provide some guidance to develop bioactive glasses with enhanced mechanical properties.","tags":["Oxide Glasses","Bioactive Glasses"],"title":"Atomistic insights into the structure and elasticity of densified 45S5 bioactive glass","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Achraf Atila","Meryem Kbirou","Said Ouaskit","Abdellatif Hasnaoui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"099d02c64f11032612c076f891bf6091","permalink":"https://Atilaac.github.io/publication/atila-2020-c/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T07:31:24.908808Z","relpermalink":"/publication/atila-2020-c/","section":"publication","summary":"We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dependence of the atomic-scale structure on the temperature and pressure conditions of Al$_{70}$Ni$_{15}$Co$_{15}$ metallic glass.

We used a local symmetry parameter to access the glass-forming ability of the metallic glasses cooled under different pressures.

However, the effect of the type of modifiers on the clustering and the tendency to form a phase separation in the glass is not investigated in detail and still not fully understood until now. Here, we use molecular dynamics to investigate the effect of the modifier type on the structure and the clustering tendency of a series of modified silicate glasses.

The effect of different modifiers on the short- and medium-range structure of the glass is also discussed.

Various compositions are studied where SiO$_2$ have been replaced by TiO$_2$. The calculated mechanical properties of our models are observed to depend linearly on TiO2 content. However, the structure‐induced changes are far from such dependence. The structural results indicate that BTS glasses are mainly built on four types of basic units: SiO$_4$, TiO$_4$, TiO$_5$ and TiO$_6$. This high structural heterogeneity induced by the three coordination states of Ti is found to have an impact on the medium range order by increasing the rings number, the polymerized regions, and by transforming Q$^3$‐Q$^4$ and Q$^2$ without neglecting the increase in Q$^5$ and Q$^6$ species.
